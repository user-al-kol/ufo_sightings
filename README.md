## UFO Sightings

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is very simple. Namely, to take a dataset from Kaggle, import it to a jupyter notebook, manipulate the data using pandas and matplotlib
and finally load the data to a database (I've chosen the PostgreSQL database).

### Important points

1) This is a simple project that is far from perfect.
2) It doesn't aim at the in-depth analysis of the data.
3) For convenience, I chose to load a small portion of the data to the database.
