## UFO Sightings

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is very simple. Namely, to take a dataset from Kaggle, import it to a jupyter notebook, manipulate the data using pandas and matplotlib
and finally load the data to a database (I've chosen the PostgreSQL database).

### Important points

1) This is a simple project that is far from perfect,
2) doesn't aim at the indepth analyses of the data.
3) I chose to load to the database a small portion of the data for convenience.
